# Small Organization Website Template
This is a Simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) based helpfull website for small organizations to use and modify as a template.

This template is great for a small organization looking to save costs from hosting on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) or [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/). This template can be forked to make a simple DIY website for a small  organization, club or group and host it on github free. If desired, a domain name can be purchased (<$15/yr) and linked to the freely hosted [github pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-started-with-github-pages). This template utilizes .yml files to store data presented on the website for simplification and clarify with minimal programing experience required to use.

## Template Features
  * Calendar using [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)
  * Events displaying [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) for location
  * Website posting updates
  * Photo and contact cards for Organization members
  * Sponsorship cards for supporting companies
  * Detailed list of Job Postings
  * Customizable for any use, licensed under MIT license (ie. do what you want)
